// The worst case complexity of quick sort is O(n2) as there is need of lot of comparisons in the worst condition. Whereas in merge sort, worst case and average case has same complexities O(n log n).
// Worst-case for Quick sort occurs when:
// Array is already sorted in the same order.
// Array is already sorted in reverse order.
// All elements are the same
// Worst-case for merge sort occurs when the left and right sub arrays in all merge operations have alternate elements.
